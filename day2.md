# Cloud Concepts and VPC

​

## 1. What are the differences between a server and your computer?

-   Servers provide services to clients, while desktops request services from servers. Servers are designed to handle many requests, while desktop computers are designed to be used by one user at a time
    ​

## 2. How can you tell whether an IP address is public or private?

-   An IPv4 address beginning with any of the following is a private address: 10.0.0.0 (class A), 172.16.0.0 (class B), 192.168.0.0 (class C)
    ​

## 3. Explain in your own words the difference between Cloud, Hybrid, and On-Premises deployment models.

-   Cloud deployment is when an organisation's infrastructure is hosted by a third-party service. On-Premises deployment is when a company hosts all of these things themselves, and hybrid is a blend of hosting some using third-party and some locally. On-Premises advantages include having full control of their own data but with great control comes great responsibility. Cloud can be broken down into 3 types: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
