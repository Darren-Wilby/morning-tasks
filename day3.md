# Cloud Services

## Decide whether the following AWS services are Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS), or Serverless and give your reasoning.

### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 is IaaS. It provides you with virtual machines which allow you to still have control over the OS, networking, and software.

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

​S3 is IaaS (I think). It mostly lines up with this as it is providing storage infrastructure, however it doesn't offer the infrastructure required for running apps and software.

### RDS (Relational Database Service)

​RDS is PaaS. It abstracts most of the management (backups, patching, scaling, maintenance) from the database whihc aligns with the PaaS model.

### Lambda

​Lambda is serverless. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers

### EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

​Both IaaS and PaaS. The environment itself is managed to make it easier to use (PaaS) but

### DynamoDB

​DynamoDb is PaaS. Like RDS it abstracts away most admin tasks.

### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

ECR is PaaS. It abstracts most of the underlying infrastructure
