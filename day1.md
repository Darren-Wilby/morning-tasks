# DevOps and The Cloud

​
Do some research to answer the following questions in your own words as best as you can.
​

## 1. What is DevOps?

​
DevOps is a concept of creating fluidity in software development between the development and operations teams.
​

## 2. What are the 3 ways of DevOps and what do they mean in your own words?

​

### First - Practices of Flow:

This is all about speeding up the time it takes for a new feature to be deployed. Starting from an idea to then being developed, operations to work on it and finally deployment to the customer. The faster this is, the happier customers are.

-   Workflow from left to right.

### Second - Practices of Feedback:

​Feedback relates to feedback from the operations team to the development team. Good communication between them improves all areas, e.g. a feature could be developed for a long time by the dev team only for it to be sent back by the operations team as they are unable to deploy it. This would be avoided if they had communicated earlier on.

-   Continuous feedback from right to left.

### Third - Practices of Continual Learning and Experimentation:

The third is focussed on making sure teams follow the first and second practices by fostering a culture of continuous learning. One way to achieve this is by taking time to ensure teams follow good practices. Another example would be to take a good idea from one team and have it be adopted by all other teams.

-   Ensure DevOps practices are followed.

## 3. What do you think a DevOps Engineer does as part of a team?

​1. As part of a team a DevOps engineer will foster a culture of continuous learning and experimentation 2. Ensure that the flow of work from the idea stage to deployment is done speedily (without being rushed) 3. Ensure that the operations team relays constant feedback to the dev teams to improve their work process 4. Is able to work as either an additional worker for the dev or ops team.​

## 4. What do you think the most important qualities of a DevOps or Cloud engineer are?

1. Solid understanding of principles of devops (3 ways etc)
2. Good communications skills to bridge the gap between dev and ops teams
3. Proficiency in cloud platforms such as AWS allows them to deploy and scale infrastructure
