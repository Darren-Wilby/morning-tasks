# Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

​
Today we are starting to work with Terraform!
​
The first step is to get setup with Terraform and their AWS Getting Started guide is a great place to start.
​
Before you get started, here are a couple of guidance points:
​
**Ignore the section Quick start tutorial**
​
There is a heading on the Terraform tutorial called **"Quick start tutorial"** that is within the **Install Terraform** section. You can IGNORE the entirety of the **Quick start tutorial** and move straight on to **Build infrastructure** stage.
​
**Remote state stage**
​
Ignore the final stage which is the remote state stage. We are going to cover that in more detail later.
​
**Authenticating terraform for your AWS account**
​
In the guide it tells you to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - this approach would be used if you are using long live credentials (and is a bit insecure as we have already discussed) so instead we can continue to leverage the refresh token and AWS SSO login approach.
​
Instead of setting the variables as indicated in the terraform guide you should perform the `aws sso login` command approach to authenticate your AWS command line.
​
Validate that your AWS CLI is authenticated using the usual `aws sts get-caller-identity` approach
​
Once your AWS CLI is authenticated then we just need to inform terraform of what your AWS profile is called. To do this run the following (replacing the REPLACE_ME section with whatever you called your AWS profile):
​

```
export AWS_PROFILE="REPLACE_ME"
```

​
Then you can run the `terraform` commands as indicated through the guide and they should authenticate fine.
​
**Directories and files**
​
Make sure to create any directories or files within this repository so that they will be included in your submission
​
**Screenshots**
​
Once you have a successful `terraform apply` outcome, take a screenshot showing the output from the command line and a second screenshot showing your EC2 instance running in the console. The screenshots should be placed within this directory.

Ok now that you've got a few guidance points here's the link to get started:

​
Once finished, make sure to commit and push your code at this point
​
**Run `terraform destroy` to remove any resources when you are done!**
